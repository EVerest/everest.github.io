#################

| This interface defines an isolation monitoring device (IMD) according to IEC 61557-8 for DC charging. This is used to verify isolation of the DC lines before starting high voltage charging and during charging.


*********
Variables
*********
| **IsolationMeasurement**:*object* (:ref:`isolation_monitor-IsolationMeasurement <isolation_monitor-IsolationMeasurement>`)
|  Isolation monitoring measurement results
|  **There is an extended definition for this object** :ref:`here <isolation_monitor-IsolationMeasurement>`.

********
Commands
********
| **start**:*void*
|  Start recurring isolation measurements. The device should monitor the isolation status until stopped and publish the resistance data in regular intervals. The actual interval is device dependent.
| **stop**:*void*
|  Stop recurring measurements. The device should stop to monitor the isolation resistance and stop publishing the data.
