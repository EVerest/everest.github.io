Auth
####
| This module implements the authentication handling for the EVerest. It is responsible for providing authorization to the connected evse managers. In addition to that, it handles the reservation management.

********************
Module Configuration
********************
| **selection_algorithm**:*string* <optional>
| *default: FindFirst*
|  The algorithm that is used to map an incoming token to a connector
| **connection_timeout**:*integer* <required>
|  Defines how many seconds an authorization is valid before it is discarded. Defines how many seconds a user can provide authorization after the plug in of a car
| **prioritize_authorization_over_stopping_transaction**:*boolean* <optional>
| *default: True*
|  Boolean value to describe the handling of parent id tokens.
| If true, a new token will be preferably used for authorization of a new connector if a connector is available. It will not be used to finish a transaction using its parent_id_token. parent_id_token will only be used to finish transaction if no connector is available for authorization anymore.
| If false, a new token will be used to finish a transaction if the parent_id_token of a present transaction matches the parent_id_token of the provided_token. Authorization to available connectors will only be provided if no transaction can be stopped using the given parent_id_token
| **ignore_connector_faults**:*boolean* <optional>
| *default: False*
|  Boolean value to describe the handling of faults on connectors.
| If true, faults reported on connectors are ignored, i.e. they can still be authorized. This should be disabled in most use cases, but e.g. in free charging applications it may be useful to allow a charging session in the following case: A connector e.g. has an overtemperature fault that at some point will clear once it is cooled down. A car is plugged in before  the error is cleared. The user would expect that the charging starts once it is cooled down. When this option is set to false,  it will not be authorized on plug in as the connector is in fault state and it will never recover until the car is replugged. If it is set to true, the authorization happens on the faulty connector and charging will start once the fault is cleared.
| If false, faulty connectors are treated as not available and will not be authorized. This is a good setting for e.g. public chargers.
