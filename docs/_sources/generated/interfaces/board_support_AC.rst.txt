################

| This interface defines the board support driver for AC power path: ControlPilot, Relais, RCD and motor lock


*********
Variables
*********
| **event**:*string* (:ref:`board_support-Event <board_support-Event>`)
|  Event from ControlPilot signal/Relais/RCD
|  **There is an extended definition for this object** :ref:`here <board_support-Event>`.
| **nr_of_phases_available**:*integer*
|  Instantaneous phase count available to car
| **telemetry**:*object* (:ref:`board_support-Telemetry <board_support-Telemetry>`)
|  Other telemetry
|  **There is an extended definition for this object** :ref:`here <board_support-Telemetry>`.

********
Commands
********
| **setup**:*void*
|  Setup config options
|  **three_phases**:*boolean*
|   true: Three phases enabled, false: only single phase
|  **has_ventilation**:*boolean*
|   true: Allow mode D charging, false: do not allow mode D charging
|  **country_code**:*string*
|   A two-letter country code in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format
|  **rcd_enabled**:*boolean*
|   true: enable RCD, false: disable RCD
| **get_hw_capabilities**:*object*
|  Get Hardware capability/limits
|  **Result**:*object* (:ref:`board_support-HardwareCapabilities <board_support-HardwareCapabilities>`)
|   Hardware capability/limits
|   **There is an extended definition for this object** :ref:`here <board_support-HardwareCapabilities>`.
| **enable**:*void*
|  Enables or disables the EVSE. Typically disabled results in control pilot state F. It must not accept cars for new charging sessions if disabled.
|  **value**:*boolean*
|   True: enabled, false: disabled.
| **pwm_on**:*void*
|  Turns PWM on with duty cycle
|  **value**:*number*
|   PWM duty cycle (>0, <1)
| **pwm_off**:*void*
|  Turns PWM off (constant high voltage)
| **pwm_F**:*void*
|  Turns PWM off with Error F (constant negative voltage)
| **allow_power_on**:*void*
|  Sets allow_power_on flag. If false, Relais must never be switched on.
|  **value**:*boolean*
|   True: allow power on, false: do not allow power on.
| **force_unlock**:*boolean*
|  Force unlock motor lock
|  **Result**:*boolean*
|   Returns true if unlocking sequence was successfully executed
| **switch_three_phases_while_charging**:*void*
|  Special command to force switching between one and three phases while charging is active. HW must go through some special sequence to ensure safe operation.
|  **value**:*boolean*
|   True: switch to 3ph, False: switch to 1ph
| **evse_replug**:*void*
|  Special command initiate a virtual replug sequence without restarting session. Emits a EvseReplugStarted event if supported and started. BSP will take care to not emit other events such as CarPluggedIn/Out during that time. Once finished it will emit a EvseReplugFinished.
|  **value**:*integer*
|   Time in ms for the duration of the replug sequence
